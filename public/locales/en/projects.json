      "description": "An online service for monitoring and destroying dangerous asteroids based on NASA API data.\nOn the main page there is a list of asteroid approaches to Earth from the current date to infinity. Loading when scrolling in portions. For each asteroid: name, size, hazard assessment, how close it will be to Earth, the exact date of the maximum approach. The approach icon depends on the danger. Filter by danger. And the option of displaying distances: in kilometers or distances to the Moon.\nIn the background of the header there is an image that should be received in the NASA APOD API (picture of the day).\nIn the detailed information on the asteroid, in addition to the information listed above, there is a list of all its approaches. For each approach: the speed relative to the Earth, the time of maximum approach to the Earth, the distance to the Earth, in orbit around which it flies.\nIn the list and on the asteroid page there is a button to add an asteroid to the list for destruction.\nThe list for destruction is a kind of basket where the selected asteroid approaches are displayed. At the end of the page there is a brig order button."
